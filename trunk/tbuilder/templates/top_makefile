# Package Makefile - One for each package, located within the package
# directory, and containing the list of source files that constitute the
# package. These files are very simple, and can potentially be auto created.

# Project Makefile - Located at $DEV_ROOT, listing all packages constitute 
# the project, the executable class as well as documentation details.
